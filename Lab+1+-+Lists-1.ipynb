A list can store many items or values inside of one overall object or structure, unlike a variable which can only store one item or value inside one object. \n\nThe items in a list can be accessed by using what is called an “index” value, which simply refers to the position of a certain item inside of a list, as lists are ordered from item 0 to the number of elements - 1. Therefore a list with 5 elements will have index positions 0 through 4. \n\nAny data can be stored inside a list, numbers, strings, or objects, but it is common practice to only have one data type per list. Therefore if my list has integers, it would ONLY have integers, not strings, doubles, objects, etc."},{"metadata":{},"id":"c0e77989-3dbb-4106-b49b-f8dfa5bfeab5","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Mini-project - Guessing game\nCreate a number guessing game and set a secret number at the beginning of the program. \nThe program will ask the player to enter a number to guess what the number is, then it’ll inform the player if they got it right or wrong."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"id":"4ff13200-3b6b-4173-8416-fa65d2234d9e","cell_type":"code","source":"# put your code here","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"id":"4584cbfd-289d-4f0d-a899-06d90d69e3fe","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Mini-Project - Dice Roll\n\nPart 1:\nCreate a random number generator using dice. \nYou must create at least 5 dice\nThe game must use conditionals (If, Else, Elif)\nThe game must use nested conditionals (if 0=0:if 1=1: do something)\n\nWhat lists should we create for the project?\nHow many loops do we need?\n\nPart 2:\nCreate a list to store your gameplay. \nCreate at least 2 lists to store your game statistics.\n\nPart 3:\nAt the end of the output your gameplay statistics\n\nPart 4:\nExchange code with your partner and begin adding comments on improvements (save your original version)\n\nPart 5:\nReturn the code and create a comparison \n\nPart 6:\nUpload the code and comparison it to Canvas.
